# Rentopolgy

In addition to programming, I enjoy board games and have slowly be building up a collection of them. As board games are meant to be played, I will often loan games out to friends. However, I can often forget which games I have loaned out and to whom. The purpose of this little app is to be a simple checkout system where I can keep track of what games I have loaded out, and to who.

A secondary goal of this project is to be an example/learning project for others looking to learn WPF with Entity Framework Core (possibly with additional features in the future)

## YouTube videos
I work on this project as part of my [live streams](https://twitch.keboo.dev) with recordings on [YouTube](https://youtube.keboo.dev).

## Structure and setup
The above videos will provide much more in-depth explanations of the code and the process by which is was built. However here is a brief outline of some of the technology used.
- The project's setup relies on my existing WPF app from my [dotnet templates](https://github.com/Keboo/DotnetTemplates)
- The project (currently) is using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as its database. This means that the storage of the application is entirely local.
- Source generators for [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm]() are heavily leveraged in this project. For more on this project see [this video](https://youtu.be/uVIzK2snugk)
